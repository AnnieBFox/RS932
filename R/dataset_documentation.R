#' TV Ability Data
#' 
#' Data from the NELS dataset used in the Keith textbook, *Multiple Regression and Beyond, 3rd Edition*. 
#'
#' Data pulled from the NELS dataset that appears in Chapter 8 of Keith (starting on page 162).  
#' The data come from a study examining the relationship between TV viewing and ability in their 
#' effects on achievement. Previous research has suggested a negative relationship between 
#' TV viewing and achievement; however, that relationship might vary depending on a child's abilities.

#' Therapist Self-Confidence Dataset
#' 
#' Dataset for MGH IHP Statistics Course RS932 
#'
#' This is a study of 164 newly graduated PTs, OTs, and SLPs. The participants were asked to rate their self-confidence 
#' managing each of their clients/patients over the period of 1 year.  The scale was a visual analog scale with 1 as 
#' completely lacking in confidence and 10 as totally confident.  An average score across all clients/patients was 
#' compiled for each therapist. They were also asked to rate their perception of the support they received from 
#' their direct supervisor over the 1 year period.  The scale was 0-100%, with 100% being full support. 
#' The therapistsâ€™ client/patients each rated their level of satisfaction with their care on a scale of -1, 
#' totally unsatisfied, to +1, completely satisfied.  An average score across all clients/patients was computed 
#' for each therapist.

#' Exam anxiety data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2021). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage., used in RS932.
#' 
#'
#' A psychologist was interested in the effects of exam stress on exam performance. She devised and validated a questionnaire to assess
#' state anxiety relating to exams (called the Exam Anxiety Questionnaire, or EAQ). This scale produced a measure of anxiety scored out of 100.
#' Anxiety was measured before an exam, and the percentage mark of each student on the exam was used to assess the exam performance. These data are fictional.
#' The fictional data contains the following variables:
#'
#'   * **ID**: participant id
#'   * **Revise**: the time spent revising for the exam (hours)
#'   * **Exam**: the percentage score of each student on the exam
#'   * **Anxiety**: anxiety score on the EAQ out of 100
#'   * **Gender**: whether the participant self-identified as male or female

#' Private Practice Dataset
#' 
#' Dataset for MGH IHP Statistics Course RS932 based on Pollack et al. (2012) described in Hayes (2017)
#'
#' This study examined whether economic stress leads to a desire to disengage from private practice as a result of 
#' the pessimism that the stress creates.  This dataset includes data from a networking group of owners of private
#' rehabilitation practices. They were interviewed to determine their perceptions of how their practices were 
#' doing, and their emotional and cognitive reactions to the current healthcare climate. The responses were 
#' used to calculate a 1) measure of economic distress (a mean of 2 items rated on a scale of 1 to 7, the higher 
#' the score, the greater the distress); 2) a measure of how optimistic or pessimistic they felt about the future 
#' of their practice, (a mean of 6 items rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with higher scores meaning more pessimistic);
#' 3) their intentions to withdraw from private practice in the near future (a mean of 3 items that were rated 
#' on a scale of 1 to 7 with higher intention to withdraw). 
#' 
#' * **own_yrs:**	years owning private practice
#' * **Ecstress:**	economic stress (higher scores = more stress)
#' * **affect:**	Pessimism (higher scores = more pessimism)   
#' * **disengag:**	Withdrawal intentions (higher more likely to withdraw)
#' * **sex:** gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
#' * **age:** age
#' * **self_eff:** entrepreneurial self-efficacy (higher = higher self-efficacy)
