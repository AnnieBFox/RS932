\details{
This is a study of 164 newly graduated PTs, OTs, and SLPs. The participants were asked to rate their self-confidence
managing each of their clients/patients over the period of 1 year.  The scale was a visual analog scale with 1 as
completely lacking in confidence and 10 as totally confident.  An average score across all clients/patients was
compiled for each therapist. They were also asked to rate their perception of the support they received from
their direct supervisor over the 1 year period.  The scale was 0-100\%, with 100\% being full support.
The therapistsâ€™ client/patients each rated their level of satisfaction with their care on a scale of -1,
totally unsatisfied, to +1, completely satisfied.  An average score across all clients/patients was computed
for each therapist.
